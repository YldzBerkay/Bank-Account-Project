 My final assignment at the end of Programming Fundamentals in Swift training on Coursera by Meta
 
 I worked with functions, loops, switch statements, structures and classes to create a functional bank account simulator. I used structures and classes to configure the bank account simulatorâ€™s operations and used loops to process user input to create valid bank accounts. Furthermore, I implemented conditional statements and switch statements to ensure the simulator runs smoothly.
